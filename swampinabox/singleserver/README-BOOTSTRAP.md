#########################
#	Quick Start	#
#########################

There are three steps to installation of swampinabox. 
Determine the hardware target for your installation and log in to that machine as your non-privileged user.

The first step is to clone the installation scripts from GitLab from the swampinabox project as 
your non-privileged user.

(1)     git clone git@swa-scm-1.mirsam.org:swamp/swampinabox.git

The second step is to clone the swamp source code from GitLab from the
six applicable projects, also as your non-privileged user.

(2)     cd
	mkdir swamp
        cd swamp
        . ../swampinabox/build_swampinabox/bin/git_clone.bash

The third step is to install the swamp source code and execute the
necessary patches to convert to swampinabox.  This step is executed as
the root user.

(3)     cd ../swampinabox/build_swampinabox
	mkdir log
	./bin/install_swampinabox.bash <username> |& tee log/install_swampinabox_`hostname -s`_<dd>.log

where <dd> starts with 00 and increments by 1 every time you rerun the install script.

Note that steps (2) and (3) are outlined in README-INSTALL.md which is
attached here and contained in the download from step (1).
