Maintaining SWAMP-in-a-Box
--------------------------


[[checking-for-updates]]
Checking for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SWAMP-in-a-Box upgrade script does not necessarily update all components
of SWAMP-in-a-Box for which a newer version might be available. Components
that require additional steps to upgrade are listed below, along with
instructions on how to upgrade them.

Assessment Platforms::

If you have previously installed additional assessment platforms, run the
following command to determine whether there are updated versions available
(the command does not require `root` access):

+
----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_check_platform_images
----

+
For any out-of-date platform images, follow the instructions on
<<add-on-platforms,installing additional assessment platforms>> for
downloading and installing the updated images. Once that is done, the
out-of-date images may be deleted.


[[updating-the-hostname]]
Updating the Host's Hostname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the SWAMP-in-a-Box install process, the hostname specified for the
host is set in the SWAMP's various configuration files and its database.
When that hostname changes, those configuration locations must be updated
in order for the system to continue functioning correctly. To set the new
hostname, as `root` (or using `sudo`), run the following command:

----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_set_web_host --force --hostname="<new hostname>"
----


Managing Disk Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box will use increasing amounts of disk space as SWAMP users
upload packages and assess them. However, disk space from temporary files
and (older) log files can be reclaimed by removing those files.

`/var/log/httpd`::

This directory contains the web server's log files. By default, when the web
server (i.e., `httpd` package) is installed, the `logrotate` utility is
configured, via `/etc/logrotate.d/httpd`, to rotate these log files and
ensure that log entries do not persist indefinitely.

`/var/www/swamp-web-server/storage/logs`::

This directory contains the SWAMP web application's backend's log files, one
per day, when it is _not_ configured to make log entries in the system log.

`/var/www/swamp-web-server/storage/framework/sessions`::

This directory contains data about SWAMP users' login sessions when the
SWAMP web application's backend is configured to store session data on the
file system (as opposed to in a cookie in the user's web browser).

`/swamp/outgoing`::

This directory contains temporary copies of SWAMP artifacts, such as the
SCARF XML for the results from an assessment, so that SWAMP users can
download them. Older files may safely be deleted from this directory. The
following `find` command, when run as `root` (or using `sudo`), will remove
any files older than 4 hours (240 minutes):

+
----
find /swamp/outgoing -mindepth 1 -mmin +240 -delete
----

`/swamp/working/results`::

This directory contains temporary copies of the artifacts produced by
assessments, before they have been fully processed and saved by the SWAMP's
backend. Each assessment gets its own subdirectory, named after its
execution record UUID. Older subdirectories may safely be deleted from this
directory, at the expense of possibly losing some debugging information for
assessments that failed. The following `find` command, when run as `root`
(or using `sudo`), will remove any subdirectories that have not changed in
14 days:

+
----
find /swamp/working/results -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -ctime +14 -delete
----


Managing Firewalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer back to the section on <<configure-firewalls,configuring firewalls>>
for information on the network traffic that the SWAMP-in-a-Box host is
expected to respond to and generate. The SWAMP-in-a-Box install/upgrade
process and supporting utility scripts do not modify the host's firewall
configuration.


[[managing-htcondor]]
Managing HTCondor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box uses an HTCondor pool to run assessments and the
<<add-on-viewers,optional Code Dx viewer>>. Each SWAMP assessment and viewer
instance is submitted to the HTCondor pool as a single job. The `condor_q`
and `condor_status` commands can be used to examine HTCondor's queue of jobs
and the resources it has for running those jobs.

[TIP]
The listings from `condor_q` and `condor_status -vm`, described below, can
also be found in the SWAMP web application. As a SWAMP administrator, go to
the System Overview page, and from there, to the Review Status page.

`condor_q`::

Lists the jobs currently in the queue. HTCondor's ID for each job is shown
in the "ID" column. The status of each job is shown in the "ST" column: "I"
for idle; "R" for running; and "H" for on-hold, indicating that the job
encountered an error.

`condor_q -better-analyze <job ID>`::

Displays detailed information about why an idle job is not currently
running. On a normally functioning system, it is normal for a job to be idle
because there are not enough CPU or memory resources available (they should
become available as other running assessments finish).

`condor_q -hold <job ID>`::

Displays detailed information about why a job is on-hold. On a normally
functioning system, no job should be on-hold.

`condor_status`::

Lists all of the available resources that HTCondor can use to run jobs. On
a normally functioning system, there should be at least one "machine" in
this list.

`condor_status -vm`::

Lists all of the available resources that HTCondor can use to run jobs that
require a virtual machine. All SWAMP jobs require a virtual machine. On
a normally functioning system, there should be at least one "machine" in
this list.


Managing SWAMP Daemons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box includes a collection of daemons that run on the host, all
managed by the `swamp` system service. These daemons must be running in
order to submit and perform assessments. The `swamp` service and the daemons
managed by it can be stopped and started using the standard commands for
interacting with system services (the commands must be run as `root` or
using `sudo`). For example:

----
service swamp start
service swamp stop
service swamp restart
----


Other Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box uses Apache HTTP Server, HTCondor, and MariaDB. For
instructions on how to interact with or administer Apache HTTP Server,
HTCondor, and MariaDB, refer to the documentation associated with each
product. Be aware that the install and upgrade process for SWAMP-in-a-Box
makes changes to their default configurations; see the SWAMP-in-a-Box
Reference Manual for further details.
