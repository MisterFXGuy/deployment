Configure Outgoing Email for SWAMP-in-a-Box
-------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

    - You need an SMTP server that you are authorized to relay mail through.
    - You need 'root' access to edit the relevant configuration files.

Step 1: Modify /etc/postfix/main.cf to use your SMTP server.

    - Set the relayhost attribute to your SMTP server.
    - Restart the 'postfix' service. You can use the following command:

            sudo service postfix restart

Step 2: Modify /var/www/swamp-web-server/.env to enable outgoing SWAMP email.

    - Set MAIL_ENABLED to "true".
    - Set MAIL_DRIVER to "sendmail".
    - Set the MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS and MAIL_FROM_NAME to the email address
      and name you want to use as the sender of outgoing SWAMP emails.

    Notes:

    - The 'sendmail' driver uses the system's postfix mail system to do the
      actual delivery of the email message. If there are issues sending a
      message, the 'sendmail' driver will attempt to retry delivery of the
      message in the background without causing the UI to wait. The 'smtp'
      driver bypasses postfix and makes connections directly to your SMTP
      server. In this case the UI will wait for an acknowledgment that the
      message was sent.

Step 3: Modify /opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf to configure outgoing email for
notifications that assessments are completed.

    - Set email.host to your SMTP server.
    - Set email.arun.subject to the subject line to be used for assessment
      completion notification emails.
    - Set email.from to the name and email address you want to use as the
      sender of assessment completion notification emails.
    - Restart the 'swamp' service so your changes to swamp.conf are in
      effect. You can use the following command:

            sudo service swamp restart


Enable "Contact Us" for SWAMP-in-a-Box
--------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

    - You must have configured outgoing email (see above).
    - You need 'root' access to edit the relevant configuration files.

Step 1: Modify /var/www/swamp-web-server/.env to configure contact
message recipients.

    - Set MAIL_CONTACT_ADDRESS to the email address of the recipient of
      "Contact Us" messages.
    - Set MAIL_CONTACT_NAME to the name of the recipient of "Contact Us"
      messages.

Step 2: Modify /var/www/html/config/config.json to enable the "Contact Us"
page and set display parameters.

    - Add a "contact" array containing a "support" array.
    - Add "email", "phoneNumber", "description", and "message", values
      to the "support" array.

    Note:

    - The config.json file defines parameters within JSON arrays.
      Therefore it is important to maintain the array format
      when editing, adding, or removing parameters in this file.

    Sample:

	"contact": {
		"support": {
			"email": "<Your support email address (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"phoneNumber": "<Your support phone number (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"description": "our support staff",
			"message": "Feel free to contact us with questions."
		},


Enable "Report Security Incident" for SWAMP-in-a-Box
----------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

    - You must have configured outgoing email (see above).
    - You must have already enabled the "Contact Us" page (see above).
    - You need 'root' access to edit the relevant configuration files.

Step 1: Modify /var/www/swamp-web-server/.env to configure security
incident message recipients.

    - Set MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS to the email address of the recipient of
      "Report Security Incident" messages.
    - Set MAIL_SECURITY_NAME to the name of the recipient of "Report
      Security Incident" messages.

Step 2: Modify /var/www/html/config/config.json to enable the
"Report Security Incident" page and set display parameters.

    - Add a "security" array to the "contact" array (see example).
    - Add "email", "phoneNumber", "description", and "message", values
      to the "security" array (see sample).

    Note:

    - The config.js file defines parameters within JSON arrays.
      Therefore it is important to maintain the array format
      when editing, adding, or removing parameters in this file.

    Sample:

	"contact": {

		"support": {
			"email": "<Your support email address (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"phoneNumber": "<Your support phone number (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"description": "our support staff",
			"message": "Feel free to contact us with questions."
		},

		"security": {
			"email": "<Your security email address (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"phoneNumber": "<Your security phone number (optional - you may delete this line)>",
			"description": "our security team",
			"message": "<Your security message here (optional - you may delete this line)>"
		}
	},
