Configure an SSL Certificate for SWAMP-in-a-Box
-----------------------------------------------

A self-signed certification is included by default when httpd and
mod_ssl are installed for SWAMP-in-a-Box. Most web browsers will flag
your SWAMP-in-a-Box website as insecure when using the self-signed
certification.

This document provides instructions for configuring SWAMP-in-a-Box to
use a real SSL certificate.

Note: The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) needs to be the main URL for
your SWAMP-in-a-Box website, for example "https://mysiab.mydomain.org".

Step 1: Acquire a SSL certificate matching your SWAMP-in-a-Box domain name
from a trusted CA. For the example above, the SSL certificate would match
"mysiab.mydomain.org".

    - Generate your private key without a passphrase.

        For the example domain name used above, the command would be:

        openssl genres -des3 -out mysiab.mydomain.org.private.key

    - Create your CSR.

        For the example domain name used above, the command would be:

        openssl req -new -key mysiab.mydomain.org.private.key -out mysiab.mydomain.org.csr

    - Purchase the SSL certificate by submitting your CSR. The vendor will
      send you the signed SSL certificate and any required intermediate
      certificates.

Step 2: Install your certification and configure it for use with
SWAMP-in-a-Box.

    - Upload certifications, along with the private key to the
      SWAMP-in-a-Box host, typically in /etc/pki/tls/certs and
      /etc/pki/tls/private.

    - Make the private key readable only by 'root'.

    - Make the certificates readable by the web server (i.e., world readable).

    - Modify "/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf".

        Set the path to your certificate and private key (based on
        the example domain used above):

            SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysiab.mydomain.org.cert
            SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/mysiab.mydomain.org.private.key

        Depending on the specific SSL certificate, you may also need
        to set the path to the following files:

            SSLCertificateChainFile
            SSLCACertificateFile

        Set the following parameters as shown:

            SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
            SSLHonorCipherOrder On
            SSLCipherSuite -ALL:EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+ECDSA+AES:EECDH+aRSA+AES:EDH+aRSA+AES:RSA+3DES
