Administrative Commands for SWAMP-in-a-Box
==========================================

The 'swamp' service
-------------------

SWAMP-in-a-Box installs a collection of daemons that run on the host, all
managed by the 'swamp' system service. These daemons must be running in
order to perform assessments. The 'swamp' service, and by extension all of
the daemons, may be stopped and started using the standard commands for
interacting with system services. For example:

    service swamp start
    service swamp stop
    service swamp restart


Other components
----------------

SWAMP-in-a-Box also makes use of the Apache HTTP Server, HTCondor, and
MariaDB. For instructions on how to interact with or administer Apache HTTP
Server, HTCondor, and MariaDB, refer to the specific documentation
associated with each product. Be aware that the install and upgrade process
for SWAMP-in-a-Box makes changes to their default configurations.
