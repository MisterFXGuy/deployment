Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.33
-----------------------------------------

1. SWAMP-in-a-Box administrators can now configure where the SWAMP web
application's backend stores its log entries. After installing or upgrading
to SWAMP-in-a-Box version 1.33, the web application's backend will create
daily log files in /var/www/swamp-web-server/storage/logs.

The web application's backend can also be configured to make log entries in
the system log, which is where they were made in previous versions of
SWAMP-in-a-Box. Refer to the SWAMP-in-a-Box Reference Manual for details.

2. CentOS and Scientific Linux 7 (32-bit and 64-bit) assessment platforms
are now available for C/C++ packages.

Any versions of GrammaTech CodeSonar and Synopsis Static Analysis (Coverity)
that were previously installed will not work with these new platforms. Refer
to the SWAMP-in-a-Box Administrator Manual for instructions on re-creating
the SWAMP tool archives for these tools and adding them to the SWAMP.

3. Updated versions of the CentOS and Scientific Linux 6.9 (32-bit and
64-bit) assessment platforms are now available for C/C++ packages. If
a CentOS or Scientific Linux 6 platform was previously installed, download
and install these new versions.

4. Code Dx version 2.8.3, a viewer for analyzing the results from
assessments, can now be added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation. You must
obtain Code Dx separately from Code Dx, Inc.

5. To support SWAMP-in-a-Box installations that do not have internet access,
we have updated the tool archive for retire.js version 1.2.10 to include
documentation and scripts for creating a version of the tool archive that
bundles vulnerability data instead of downloading it from the internet for
each assessment.

6. SWAMP-in-a-Box no longer requires that the host be configured with
a timezone of UTC, and the SWAMP-in-a-Box installer and upgrader no longer
modifies the host's timezone.

All dates and times in the SWAMP web application are displayed in the web
browser's local time. All dates and times in log files are in the host's
local time. All dates and times stored with database records are converted
to UTC.

7. SWAMP-in-a-Box now includes a script for checking the health of the
installation. Refer to the Troubleshooting section of the SWAMP-in-a-Box
Administrator Manual for details.

8. SWAMP users can now add a list of paths to files or directories to
exclude from assessments for Python, Ruby, and Web Scripting packages.
For Ruby packages, this does not apply to the tools Dawn and Brakeman,
which do whole program analysis.

9. General enhancements and bug fixes.


Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.32
-----------------------------------------

1. Parasoft C/C++test version 10.3, a tool for assessing C/C++ packages, can
now be added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation. You must license Parasoft
C/C++test and obtain either the 32-bit or 64-bit tool archive files
separately from Parasoft.

2. Parasoft Jtest version 10.3, a tool for assessing Java Source packages,
can now be added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation. You must license Parasoft
Jtest and obtain either the 32-bit or 64-bit tool archive files separately
from Parasoft.

3. OWASP Dependency Check version 2.1.1, a tool for assessing Java Source
and Java Bytecode packages, can now be added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box
installation. The tool can be configured to get National Vulnerability
Database information from a server that you set up to retrieve updates on
a periodic basis, or, in cases where SWAMP-in-a-Box runs without internet
access, a version of the tool with static National Vulnerability Database
information can be created and installed. Versions of OWASP Dependency Check
bundled with previous installations of SWAMP-in-a-Box will be removed when
you upgrade.

4. Spotbugs version 3.1.0 is now available for assessing Java Source Code
and Java Bytecode packages. This tool is a fork of Findbugs. When you choose
to run assessments for a Java package using "All" tools, a Spotbugs
assessment will be generated but a Findbugs assessment will not. You can
still specifically select Findbugs to generate a Findbugs assessment.

5. SWAMP now provides support for C/C++ packages that build using autotools
to generate their configure files. "Autotools+Configure+Make" is now
available as a Build System for C/C++ packages.

6. Assessment Completion Notification emails can now be sent from
SWAMP-in-a-Box installations configured to enable outgoing SWAMP emails.

7. We've made improvements to the Native result viewer. Specifically,
results are now spread across multiple pages. Controls are available to set
the number of weaknesses shown on a page and navigate from page to page.

8. CentOS and Scientific Linux 6.9 (32-bit and 64-bit) assessment platforms
are now available. If a CentOS or Scientific Linux 6.7 platform was
previously installed as an add on, we recommend you download and install
these new versions.

9. SWAMP administrators can now stop Condor jobs from the Review Status
page. Assessment and Metric runs are not completed and assigned a status of
Terminated. Viewer runs are stopped without saving the viewer database, so
any changes made in the current viewer session are lost.

10. General enhancements and bug fixes.


Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.31
-----------------------------------------

1. Synopsis Static Analysis (Coverity), a tool for assessing C/C++ packages,
can now be added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation. You must license Synopsis
Static Analysis and obtain either the 32-bit or 64-bit tool archive files
separately from Synopsis, Inc.

2. Documentation for SWAMP-in-a-Box has been reorganized into an
Administrator Manual and a Reference Manual. Each comes as a PDF and HTML
document, which can be found in `/opt/swamp/doc` on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

3. New versions of the CentOS and Scientific Linux 6.7 (32-bit and 64-bit)
assessment platforms are available. If any of these platforms was previously
installed as an add on, we recommend you download and install the updated
versions.

4. The CentOS and Scientific Linux 5.11 (32-bit and 64-bit) assessment
platforms are no longer supported. If any of these platforms was previously
installed as an add on, they will be removed as part of the upgrade to
SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.31.

5. Added new versions and/or updates for the following assessment tools:
Checkstyle, error-prone, Findbugs, PMD, and XML Lint.

Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.30
-----------------------------------------

1. SWAMP-in-a-Box can now be configured to use an LDAP or LDAP-compatible
Active Directory server for managing user accounts.

2. SWAMP-in-a-Box can now be configured to allow GitHub, Google, and CILogon
accounts to be linked to SWAMP user accounts, allowing users to sign into
the SWAMP using their third-party credentials.

3. The GrammaTech CodeSonar tool for assessing C/C++ packages can now be
added to a SWAMP-in-a-Box installation. You must license CodeSonar and
obtain either the 32-bit or 64-bit installers for CodeSonar separately from
GrammaTech, Inc.

4. SWAMP users can now add Application Passwords to their SWAMP accounts.
These passwords can be used with the SWAMP plugins for Eclipse and Jenkins to
allow them to connect to the SWAMP without using the users' main passwords.

5. Java 8 is now the default Java version when creating new Java source and
Java bytecode packages.

6. The SWAMP now uses the "recursive" option to include linked sub-modules
when pulling code from GitHub to create a new package or when adding a new
package version.

7. The Native viewer for assessment results now includes information about
the package, tool, and platform used, along with start and completion times,
for the assessment.

8. SWAMP users can now change their SWAMP username when editing their
profile page.

9. Added new versions and/or updates for the following assessment tools:
Brakeman, Dawn, Reek, RuboCop, and ruby-lint.

10. The SWAMP-in-a-Box install and upgrade scripts now configure the web
server (Apache) to disallow HTTP connections. The SWAMP must be accessed
using HTTPS.

11. The SWAMP-in-a-Box install and upgrade scripts no longer attempt to
configure firewall settings on the host. Required configuration is now
documented in the `README-BUILD-SERVER.md` file that is included with the
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer.

12. General enhancements and bug fixes.


Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.29
-----------------------------------------

1. Added support for 5 new programming languages: CSS, HTML, JavaScript,
PHP, and XML.

2. Added the following 9 assessment tools for web scripting languages: CSS
Lint, ESLint, Flow, HTML Tidy, JSHint, PHPMD, PHP_CodeSniffer, Retire.js,
and XML Lint.

3. Added new versions and/or updates for the following assessment tools:
Bandit, Flake8, Pylint, checkstyle, OWASP Dependency Check, error-prone,
FindBugs, and PMD.

4. When adding a new package or adding a new version to an existing package,
users have the option to select an archive file from the local file system
or enter an external URL and a checkout argument (branch, tag, or commit)
for a remote Git repository.

5. Improved error reporting for assessment failures. Successful assessment
runs are no longer erroneously reported as having finished with errors.
Assessments that complete with a status of “finished with errors – retry”
can be re-run and should complete successfully.

6. Updated the “Status.out and Debugging SWAMP Failures” document on the
Help page to assist with debugging failed assessments. Failed assessments
now show the contents of the status.out file at the top of the Failed
Assessment Report (by clicking the “! Error” button in the Results column).

7. The statuses shown on the Results page have been updated to better
indicate what is happening as assessment jobs are processed.

8. Minimum hardware requirements have increased to 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of
RAM.

9. General enhancements and bug fixes.


Noteworthy Changes in SWAMP-in-a-Box 1.28.1
-------------------------------------------

1. Added a new assessment tool: OWASP Dependency Check. This tool can be
used to assess Java 7 and 8 Source, and Java 7 and 8 Bytecode packages.

2. Added new versions of the cppcheck assessment tool. Updated the following
assessment tools: Bandit, Clang Static Analyzer, and cppcheck.

3. Updated platform versions and dependencies. All platforms from previous
releases have been deprecated. When upgrading to 1.28.1, existing
assessments will be modified to use the Ubuntu Linux version 16.04 platform.
The new platforms will work without an internet connection unless the
package being assessed requires the internet to build.

4. Added the "Status.out and Debugging SWAMP Failures" document to the Help
page to assist with debugging failed assessment runs.

5. Improved the reporting of assessment error messages in the Failed
Assessment Run Report (accessed by clicking the Error "!" button on an
assessment that finished with errors). Improved the reporting of failed
steps in the status.out file for failed assessment runs (found in the
results.tar.gz archive, downloadable from a Failed Assessment Report).

6. Added the ability to download assessment results in XML format. For
assessments that finished successfully and have at least one weakness, the
weakness count icon on the Assessment Results page is a link to download the
scarf.xml file.

7. Assessments display "default" as the platform if the default platform
will be used to run an assessment. Most supported package types have a
default platform of Ubuntu Linux version 16.04. Only C/C++ package types
allow selecting a platform when adding assessments.

8. The system no longer attempts to re-run a failed assessment, allowing
assessments to finish more quickly.
