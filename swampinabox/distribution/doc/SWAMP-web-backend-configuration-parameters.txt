SWAMP Web Application Server Configuration
==========================================

The ".env" file
---------------
At the top level of the web server directory, you will find a file
called ".env".  This file contains the various parameter names and
values that are used to configure the SWAMP web application.  You must
have root access to modify this file.

This file contains the following parameters:

Web Application settings
------------------------
These are miscellaneous parameters related to the SWAMP web application.

    APP_ENV
    : a description of the SWAMP environment
    This is informational. When installing SWAMP-in-a-Box, APP_ENV is
    set to "SWAMP-in-a-Box".

    APP_DEBUG
    : whether verbose Laravel debugging is on or off
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "true", web server errors
    return a detailed error page through the Laravel framework. When
    set to "false", such errors return a page that says "whoops, looks
    like something went wrong." APP_DEBUG is set to "false" for
    SWAMP-in-a-Box.

    APP_URL
    : the URL used to access SWAMP web routes
    APP_URL is determined when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed
    based on the hostname of the SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    APP_CORS_URL
    : the URL used to access the SWAMP web site
    APP_CORS_URL is determined when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
    installed based on the hostname of SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    Note: For SWAMP-in-a-Box installations the APP_URL and the
    APP_CORS_URL are the same.

    APP_FLOODLIGHT
    : URL and port for the Floodlight server
    This is not applicable for a SWAMP-in-the-Box installation.

    APP_INCOMING
    : the path to the directory used to temporarily store files uploaded
    for new packages
    This should always be set to "/swamp/incoming/".

    APP_KEY
    : a random encryption key used by the Laravel framework
    This can be any 16 or 32 character string. APP_KEY is set to a
    random 32 character string when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed and
    should not need to be changed afterwards.

HT Condor settings
------------------
These parameters provide the SWAMP web application access to the HT Condor
collector.

    HTCONDOR_COLLECTOR
    : the host name of the HT Condor Collector
    HTCONDOR_COLLECTOR is determined when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
    installed based on the hostname of the SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

Mail settings
-------------
These parameters are related to outgoing email sent by the SWAMP web
application. By default, SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed with outgoing mail
disabled.

    MAIL_ENABLED
    Whether the SWAMP web application is configured for outgoing mail
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "false", outgoing mail is
    disabled and the subsequent mail-related settings are not used.
    When outgoing email is disabled, all functionality that would
    otherwise result in an email being sent by the system runs without
    sending the email. Specifically:
    - username is displayed instead of email throughout the user
      interface.
    - Permission requests, project invitations, and SWAMP admin
      invitations are handled exclusively through the new notification
      system.
    - New user accounts do not go through a "pending" state and are
      immediately activated (without need of verification).
    - The option to receive an email on completion of an assessment
      is removed.
    - The Administrator Settings page for Restricted Domains is removed.
    - The Administrator Settings page for System Emails is removed
    - Contact Us and Report Security Incident pages (if enabled) do not
      include a means to submit a message directly through the web
      interface.
    MAIL_ENABLED is set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    Note: Prior to setting MAIL_ENABLED to "true" and configuring the
    other corresponding mail settings in the .env file, you must first
    configure an outgoing email server for the SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

    MAIL_DRIVER
    : the driver used to send outgoing email.
    Set to "smtp" or "sendmail". The "sendmail" driver uses the system's
    postfix mail system to do the actual delivery of the email message.
    The "smtp" driver bypasses postfix and makes connections directly to
    your SMTP server to try and deliver the message. With the "smtp"
    driver, the UI will wait for an acknowledgment that the message was
    sent. Whereas, if there are issues sending, the "sendmail" driver via
    postfix will attempt to retry delivering of the message in the
    background without causing the UI to wait. Therefore we recommend
    using the "sendmail" driver.

    MAIL_HOST
    : the hostname of the SMTP server
    This is applicable only if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp".

    MAIL_PORT
    : the SMTP port of the SMTP server
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp".

    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS
    : the email address to be used as the sender for outgoing SWAMP email

    MAIL_FROM_NAME
    : the name to be used as the sender of outgoing SWAMP email

    MAIL_CONTACT_ADDRESS
    : the email address to which messages submitted via the Contact Us
    page are sent
    Use this to direct contact messages to a specific administrator or
    help desk.

    MAIL_CONTACT_NAME
    : the name to which messages submitted via the Contact Us page are
    sent

    MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS
    : the email address to which messages submitted via the Report
    Security Incident page are sent
    Use this to direct security messages to a specific administrator or
    help desk.

    MAIL_SECURITY_NAME
    : the name to which messages submitted via the Report Security
    Incident page are sent

    MAIL_ENCRYPTION
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server uses
    encryption, the type of encryption used
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server uses encryption. Otherwise, set this to "null".

    MAIL_USERNAME
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires a
    username/password, the username
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server requires a username/password. Otherwise, set
    this to "null".

    MAIL_PASSWORD
    : if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the SMTP server requires a
    username/password, the password
    This is only applicable if the MAIL_DRIVER is set to "smtp" and the
    specified SMTP server requires a username/password. Otherwise, set
    this to "null".

LDAP settings
-------------
These parameters are related to configuring an LDAP server to store
user-related personal information for a SWAMP instance. When SWAMP is
not configured to use an LDAP server, user-related personal information
is stored in the mysql database.
When installed, a SWAMP-in-the-Box system is not configured to use an
LDAP server.

    LDAP_ENABLED
    : whether the SWAMP web application stores user data in an LDAP
    server
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "false", a record is created
    for each SWAMP user in the project database. When set to "true", a
    record is created for each SWAMP user in the LDAP server.
    LDAP_ENABLED is set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    LDAP_HOST
    : the hostname of the LDAP server
    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

    LDAP_PORT
    : the port of the LDAP server
    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

    LDAP_WEB_USER
    : the username of the LDAP user SWAMP uses to get information about
    SWAMP users from LDAP

    This is only applicable if LDAP_ENABLED is set to "true".

Third-Party login settings
--------------------------
SWAMP can be configured to allow users to sign in with using credentials
from third party sites. This requires setting up an OAuth Application
for each third party site. Supported third party sites are GitHub, Google, and
CILogon. When installed, a SWAMP-in-the-Box system is not configured to
allow any third party logins.

    GITHUB_ENABLED
    : whether the SWAMP web application allows sign-in via GitHub
    Set to "true" or "false". When set to "true", SWAMP provides a means
    to sign up and sign in via a GitHub account. GITHUB_ENABLED is
    set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    to sign up and sign in via a CILogon account. CILOGON_ENABLED is
    set to "false" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    CILOGON_CLIENT_ID
    : the Client ID set in the CILogon OAuth Application
    This is only applicable when CILOGON_ENABLED is set to "true".

    CILOGON_CLIENT_SECRET
    : the Client Secret set in the CILogon OAuth Application
    This is only applicable when CILOGON_ENABLED is set to "true".

API settings
------------
These parameters provide access to an experimental interface for documenting
the SWAMP web API. This interface requires additional database tables that are
not part of the SWAMP-in-a-Box install.

    API_EXPLORER_ENABLED
    : whether the API Explorer interface is made available.
    API_EXPLORER_ENABLED should always be set to "false" for a
    SWAMP-in-a-Box installation

Session related settings
------------------------
These parameters define how session (logon) cookies behave.

    SESSION_DRIVER
    : the driver used to manage user session data
    This is set to "cookie" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed. This
    should not be changed.
