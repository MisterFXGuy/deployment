Configure Assessments to Run Without Internet Access
----------------------------------------------------

To configure assessments to run without Internet access, modify
/opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf such that the line

    SWAMP-in-a-Box.internet-inaccessible = false

reads instead as

    SWAMP-in-a-Box.internet-inaccessible = true

(You will need 'root' access in order to modify this file.)

Any assessments submitted after making this change should no longer fail due
to not having access to the Internet as long as the packages being assessed
do NOT specify additional dependencies or use build scripts that attempt to
access the Internet.
