SWAMP Web Application Front End Configuration
=============================================

The "config.json" file
====================
In the "config" folder of the www-front-end web application, you should
find a file called "config.json". This file contains a set of parameter
names and values (in JSON format) that are used to configure the front
end web application.

This file contains the following parameters:

Web Services
============
These parameters are related to the SWAMP web application routes.

    servers.web
    : the URL used to access SWAMP web routes
    This is determined when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed based on the
    hostname of SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

Contact Information
===================
These parameters are related to display of information on the Contact Us
and Report Security Incident pages. If this section of information is
not included in the file, the link to the Contact page in the SWAMP menu
is hidden. This section is not included when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
installed.

Support
-------
These parameters are related to the Contact Us page.

    contact.support.email
    : the email address displayed for Contact Us messages

    contact.support.phoneNumber

    : the description of the person or team receiving messages displayed
    for Contact Us messages

    contact.support.message
    : additional text displayed for Contact Us messages

Security
--------
These parameters are related to the Report Security Incident. If the
Support section is defined but the Security section is not included
in the file, the SWAMP web application does not proved a link from
the Contact Us page to the Report Security Incident page.

    : the email address displayed for Report Security Incident messages

    contact.security.phoneNumber
    : the phone number displayed for Report Security Incident messages

Cookie settings
===============
These settings are related to SWAMP layout cookies, which are used to
persist the state of various layout elements: Position of the Navigation
Bar, State of the Show Numbering flag, State of the Auto Refresh flag,
and State of the Show Grouping flag.

    cookie.name
    This parameter is not currently used. This is set to "swampuuid"
    when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    cookie.domain
    : the name of the domain for the SWAMP layout cookies
    Set to "null" to use the same domain name as the APP_URL. This is
    set to "null" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    cookie.path
    : the path for SWAMP layout cookies
    This is set to "/" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    cookie.secure
    : whether SWAMP layout cookies are sent for encrypted connections
    only
    This is set to "true" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

Option flags
============
These settings affect configurable behavior in the SWAMP web
application.

    options.assessments.allow_multiple_tool_selection
    : determines whether the "All" option is present when selecting tools on
    the Add/Run New Assessments page
    This is set to "true" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

    options.assessments.allow_viewing_zero_weaknesses
    : determines whether assessment results with zero weaknesses can be
    selected and sent to the Code Dx assessment viewer
    This is set to "true" when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed.

defines parameters within arrays. Therefore it is important to maintain the
JSON array format when editing, adding, or removing parameters in this file.
