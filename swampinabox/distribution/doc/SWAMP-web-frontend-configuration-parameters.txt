SWAMP Web Application Front End Configuration
=============================================

The "config.json" file
====================
In the "config" folder of the www-front-end web application, you should
find a file called "config.json". This file contains a set of parameter
names and values (in JSON format) that are used to configure the front
end web application.

For SWAMP-in-a-Box, this file is located at:
/var/www/html/config/config.json

This file contains the following parameters:

Web Services
============
These parameters are related to the SWAMP web application routes.

    servers.web
    : the URL used to access SWAMP web routes
    This is determined when SWAMP-in-a-Box is installed based on the
    hostname of SWAMP-in-a-Box machine.

Contact Information
===================
These parameters are related to display of information on the Contact Us
and Report Security Incident pages. If this section of information is
not included in the file, the link to the Contact page in the SWAMP menu
is hidden. This section is not included when SWAMP-in-a-Box is
installed.

-------
These parameters are related to the display of information on the 
Contact Us page.

web application does not proved a link from the Contact Us page 
to the Report Security Incident page.

    contact.security.email
    : the email address displayed for Report Security Incident messages.
    This should correspond with the value for the MAIL_SECURITY_ADDRESS
