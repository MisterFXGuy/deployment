Configuring Assessments to Run Without Internet Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when an assessment is performed, the platform will first attempt
to update its collection of installed packages. This step will fail when the
SWAMP-in-a-Box host's access to the internet is limited, which will in turn
cause the assessment as a whole to fail. For such hosts, it is possible to
configure SWAMP-in-a-Box such that platforms skip this step.

[NOTE]
This configuration will *not* make a difference if the package being
assessed specifies additional dependencies or if it uses a build system or
script that requires access to the internet. If the assessment framework
cannot download and install the additional dependencies, or if the build
fails due to not being able to access resources on the internet, the
assessment will still fail.


==== Before You Begin ====

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.


==== Procedure ====

Modify `/opt/swamp/etc/swamp.conf` such that the line

----
SWAMP-in-a-Box.internet-inaccessible = false
----

reads instead as

----
SWAMP-in-a-Box.internet-inaccessible = true
----

Any assessments submitted after making this change should no longer fail due
to not having access to the internet, subject to the caveats noted above.
