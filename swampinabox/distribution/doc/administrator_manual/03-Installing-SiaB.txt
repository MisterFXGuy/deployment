Installing SWAMP-in-a-Box
-------------------------


Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

* The install script will prompt for the DNS hostname to use for the host.
  It must match the hostname that users will use to access the SWAMP web
  application and the hostname on the SSL certificates for the host's web
  server.

* The install script will prompt for the initial values to use for the
  following passwords, which can then be used to access the SWAMP web
  application and database that are installed as part of SWAMP-in-a-Box:

  ** Database `root` password: SWAMP-in-a-Box uses MariaDB as its database
  backend. This is the password for the database's `root` user. It may be
  different from the host operating system's `root` user's password (the
  database maintains a separate collection of user accounts for accessing
  it).

+
[IMPORTANT]
*Do not forget this password. It is required to upgrade SWAMP-in-a-Box and
reset the passwords below.*

  ** Database web password: This is the password used by the SWAMP web
  application's backend to connect to the database.

  ** Database SWAMP services password: This is the password used by
  SWAMP-in-a-Box's system daemons and backend processes to connect to the
  database.

  ** SWAMP administrator account password: This is the password for the
  SWAMP web application's `admin-s` account, which is created during the
  install process and can be used to administer the SWAMP.

* We strongly recommend running `yum update` (as `root` or using `sudo`)
  to ensure that any software installed on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host is up to
  date. This is especially important if there has been a new release of
  CentOS (or whatever similar Linux distribution is installed on the host)
  since the host was initially set up. The steps below will likely cause
  a partial update to the new release, which might leave the host in an
  inconsistent state.


Obtain the SWAMP-in-a-Box Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit https://github.com/mirswamp/deployment for instructions on how to
download SWAMP-in-a-Box as a pre-packaged installer, which is what the
instructions below assume you are working with.


Extract the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, move or copy the following files into the same
directory (any user's home directory is sufficient, for example):

  * `extract-installer.bash`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-installer.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-platforms.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-tools.tar.gz`

From that directory, run `extract-installer.bash`:

----
bash extract-installer.bash
----

When the script completes successfully, it will display the location of the
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer. The instructions below will use `<installer-dir>`
to refer to that directory.


Install SWAMP-in-a-Box's Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory `<installer-dir>/repos` contains set up scripts that will

  * configure package repositories,
  * install dependencies,
  * enable required services, and
  * create required user accounts.

Even if you have gone through this step on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host for
a previous release of SWAMP-in-a-Box, it is important to run the scripts for
the current release as they will ensure that the correct versions of
SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies are installed.

If your host has unrestricted access to the internet, as `root` (or using
`sudo`), run the `install-all.bash` script corresponding to your host's
distribution:

----
<installer-dir>/repos/CentOS-6/install-all.bash
<installer-dir>/repos/CentOS-7/install-all.bash
----

If your host has restricted access to the internet, see
<<installing-dependencies>> for a list of SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies so
that you can determine how best to install them on the host. Continue with
the steps below after you have installed the dependencies.


Run the Main SWAMP-in-a-Box Install Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As `root` (or using `sudo`), run `install_swampinabox.bash`:

----
<installer-dir>/bin/install_swampinabox.bash
----

The script will prompt you for the hostname and passwords listed above.

The script's output will be saved to a file, the exact location of which
will be listed at the end of the install. If the install is unsuccessful,
the log will be helpful in determining the cause.


Verify that the Install Was Successful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://<SWAMP-in-a-Box-hostname>/.

2. Sign in with the administrator account/user:

  - Username: admin-s
  - Password: <the one entered during the install process>

3. Upload a package, create and run a new assessment of it, and view the
   results. Sample packages can be found in `<installer-dir>/sample_packages`;
   see the `README.txt` file in that directory for more information.
