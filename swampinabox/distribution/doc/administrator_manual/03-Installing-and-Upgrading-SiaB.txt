Installing and Upgrading SWAMP-in-a-Box
---------------------------------------

This section goes through the steps involved in installing a new
SWAMP-in-a-Box and upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box.


Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


==== Before Installing a New SWAMP-in-a-Box ====

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

* The install script will prompt for the DNS hostname to use for the host.
  It must match the hostname that users will use to access the SWAMP web
  application and the hostname on the <<configure-ssl-certs,SSL certificates>>
  for the host's web server.

* The install script will prompt for the initial values to use for the
  following passwords, which can then be used to access the SWAMP web
  application and database that are installed as part of SWAMP-in-a-Box:

  ** Database `root` password: SWAMP-in-a-Box uses MariaDB as its database
  backend. This is the password for the database's `root` user. It may be
  different from the host operating system's `root` user's password (the
  database maintains a separate collection of user accounts for accessing
  it).

+
[IMPORTANT]
*Do not forget this password. It is required to upgrade SWAMP-in-a-Box and
reset the passwords below.*

  ** Database web password: This is the password used by the SWAMP web
  application's backend to connect to the database.

  ** Database SWAMP services password: This is the password used by
  SWAMP-in-a-Box's system daemons and backend processes to connect to the
  database.

  ** SWAMP administrator account password: This is the password for the
  SWAMP web application's `admin-s` account, which is created during the
  install process and can be used to administer the SWAMP.


==== Before Upgrading an Existing SWAMP-in-a-Box ====

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

* You will need `root` access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box database.

* The SWAMP-in-a-Box host must currently have version 1.29 or later of
  SWAMP-in-a-Box installed. Upgrades from earlier versions are not supported
  and will likely result in a non-working system. Older systems should be
  upgraded to 1.29 or 1.30 first, before upgrading them to a more recent
  version.


Run `yum update`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend running `yum update` (as `root` or using `sudo`) to ensure that
any software installed on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host is up-to-date. This is
especially important when there has been a new release of the host's
operating system since the host was initially set up, in which case the
steps below would likely cause a partial update to the new release, which
might leave the host in an inconsistent and non-working state.


Obtain the SWAMP-in-a-Box Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit https://github.com/mirswamp/deployment for instructions on how to
download SWAMP-in-a-Box as a pre-packaged installer, which is what the
instructions below assume you are working with.


Extract the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, move or copy the following files into the same
directory (any user's home directory is sufficient, for example):

  * `extract-installer.bash`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-installer.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-platforms.tar.gz`
  * `swampinabox-<version>-tools.tar.gz`

From that directory, run `extract-installer.bash`:

----
bash extract-installer.bash
----

When the script completes successfully, it will display the location of the
SWAMP-in-a-Box installer. The instructions below will use `<installer-dir>`
to refer to that directory.


Install/Upgrade SWAMP-in-a-Box's Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory `<installer-dir>/repos` contains set up scripts that will

  * configure package repositories,
  * install dependencies,
  * enable required services, and
  * create required user accounts.

Even if you have gone through this step on the SWAMP-in-a-Box host for
a previous release of SWAMP-in-a-Box, it is important to run the scripts for
the current release as they will ensure that the correct versions of
SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies are installed.

If your host has unrestricted access to the internet, as `root` (or using
`sudo`), run the `install-all.bash` script:

----
<installer-dir>/repos/install-all.bash
----

If your host has restricted access to the internet, see
<<installing-dependencies>> for a list of SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies so
that you can determine how best to install them on the host. Continue with
the steps below after you have installed the dependencies.

If you run into issues with installing SWAMP-in-a-Box's dependencies,
consult <<troubleshooting-installing-dependencies,the troubleshooting
appendix>> for possible solutions.


Run the Main SWAMP-in-a-Box Install/Upgrade Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As `root` (or using `sudo`):

* If you're installing a new SWAMP-in-a-Box, run `install_swampinabox.bash`:

+
----
<installer-dir>/bin/install_swampinabox.bash
----

* If you're upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, run `upgrade_swampinabox.bash`:

+
----
<installer-dir>/bin/upgrade_swampinabox.bash
----

Each script will prompt you for the passwords and other information listed
above. Output will be saved to a log file, the exact location of which will
be listed at the end of the process. If the install or upgrade is
unsuccessful, the log file will be helpful in determining the cause.

When upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, the script will also create
a backup of the SWAMP's databases before making any modifications to them.
Specifically, the following files will be created in the directory from
which you run the upgrade:

  * `bkup_all_databases.<YYYY_MM_DD>.sql`
  * `bkup_information_schema.<YYYY_MM_DD>.sql`


Verify that the Install/Upgrade Was Successful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://<SWAMP-in-a-Box-hostname>/.

2. Sign in to the SWAMP with the administrator account (username: `admin-s`).

3. Upload a package, create and run a new assessment of it, and view the
   results. Sample packages can be found in `<installer-dir>/sample_packages`;
   see the `README.txt` file in that directory for more information about
   the samples.


Check for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After upgrading an existing SWAMP-in-a-Box, refer to the section on
<<checking-for-updates,checking for updates>> to determine whether there are
components that still need to be upgraded. For example, if you have
previously added on an <<add-on-platforms,additional assessment platform>>
and there is an updated version of that platform available, you will have to
download the new version separately and install it.
