Configuring an SSL Certificate for SWAMP-in-a-Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A self-signed certification is included by default when `httpd` and
`mod_ssl` are installed for SWAMP-in-a-Box. Most web browsers will flag your
SWAMP-in-a-Box website as insecure when using the self-signed certification.
This section provides instructions for configuring SWAMP-in-a-Box to use
an SSL certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.

[NOTE]
Below, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) needs to correspond to the
main URL for your SWAMP-in-a-Box website, for example
`https://mysib.example.org`.


==== Acquire the SSL Certificate ====

The first step is to acquire a SSL certificate matching your SWAMP-in-a-Box
domain name from a trusted certificate authority (CA). For the example
above, the SSL certificate would match `mysib.example.org`.

1. Generate a private key without a passphrase. For the example domain name
used above, the command would be:

+
----
openssl genres -des3 -out mysib.example.org.private.key
----

2. Create your CSR. For the example domain name used above, the command
would be:

+
----
openssl req -new -key mysib.example.org.private.key -out mysib.example.org.csr
----

3. Purchase the SSL certificate by submitting your CSR. The vendor will send
you the signed SSL certificate and any required intermediate certificates.


==== Install the SSL Certificate ====

The second step is to install the certificate on your SWAMP-in-a-Box and
configure it for use with Apache (`httpd`).

1. Copy the certificates, along with the private key, to the SWAMP-in-a-Box
host, typically in `/etc/pki/tls/certs` and `/etc/pki/tls/private`.

2. Make the private key readable only by `root`.

3. Make the certificates readable by the web server (i.e., world readable).

4. Modify `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf`.

+
Set the path to your certificate and private key (based on the example
domain used above):

+
----
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysib.example.org.cert
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/mysib.example.org.private.key
----

+
Depending on the specific SSL certificate, you may also need to set the path
to the following files:

+
----
SSLCertificateChainFile
SSLCACertificateFile
----

+
Set the following parameters as shown:

+
----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLCipherSuite EDH+CAMELLIA:EDH+aRSA:EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EECDH:+CAMELLIA128:+AES128:+SSLv3:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED:!IDEA:!ECDSA:kEDH:CAMELLIA128-SHA:AES128-SHA
