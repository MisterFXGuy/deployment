Checking for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SWAMP-in-a-Box upgrade script does not necessarily update all components
of SWAMP-in-a-Box for which a newer version might be available. For example,
if you have previously added on an <<add-on-platforms,additional assessment
platform>> and there is an updated version of that platform available, you
will have to download the new version separately and install it.

To check whether updated assessment platforms are available, run the
following command (it does not require `root` access):

----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_check_platform_images
----


Updating the Host's Hostname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the SWAMP-in-a-Box install process, the hostname specified for the
host (usually, the host's detected hostname) is set in the SWAMP's various
configuration files and its database. When the host's hostname changes,
those configuration locations need to be updated in order for the system to
continue functioning correctly. To do so, as `root` (or using `sudo`), run
the following command:

----
/opt/swamp/bin/swamp_set_web_host <new hostname>
----


Managing the `swamp` System Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box includes a collection of daemons that run on the host, all
managed by the `swamp` system service. These daemons must be running in
order to submit and perform assessments. The `swamp` service and the daemons
managed by it can be stopped and started using the standard commands for
interacting with system services (the commands must be run as `root` or
using `sudo`). For example:

----
service swamp start
service swamp stop
service swamp restart
----


Other Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SWAMP-in-a-Box makes use of Apache HTTP Server, HTCondor, and MariaDB. For
instructions on how to interact with or administer Apache HTTP Server,
HTCondor, and MariaDB, refer to the documentation associated with each
product. Be aware that the install and upgrade process for SWAMP-in-a-Box
makes changes to their default configurations; see the SWAMP-in-a-Box
Reference Manual for further details.
