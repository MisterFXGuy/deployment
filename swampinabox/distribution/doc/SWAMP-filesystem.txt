Filesystem for SWAMP-in-a-Box
=============================

This file specifies the application components that comprise SWAMP-in-a-Box,
and indicates their use of and impact on the filesystem.

Characterization of use and impact is divided into the following categories:

(C) configuration - location of files for configuring SWAMP-in-a-Box
(L) log           - location of log files
(R) run-time      - location of temporary and/or intermediate files
(S) storage       - location of files that are stored on a long-term basis

In general, files marked by (R) and (L) can be deleted in the case of
filesystem overflow, in the order of (L) followed by (R). Files marked by (S)
can be deleted with ramifications to the normal functioning of the system. In
particular, deletion of tools, platform images, and/or packages will render
those objects unavailable to the system. Deletion of A-Run results will
prevent future viewing of those results.
