Installing Additional Assessment Platforms
------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

    - SWAMP-in-a-Box has been installed.
    - You have 'root' access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box host.
    - You have 'root' access to the SWAMP-in-a-Box database.

Step 1: Obtain the VM disk images for the additional platforms you wish to
run assessments on.

    1. Visit https://platform.swampinabox.org/platform-images/.

    2. Download the '.qcow2.gz' files corresponding to the additional
       platforms you wish to run assessments on. The naming scheme for
       these files is as follows:

            condor-[Linux distribution]-[version]-[32 or 64 bit]-master-[date].qcow2.gz

       When downloading the files, name your copies exactly as shown on
       https://platform.swampinabox.org/. Otherwise, the install script
       in the next step will not recognize them as supported platforms.

Step 2: Add the VM disk images to your SWAMP-in-a-Box.

    1. Copy the files you downloaded in the previous step to your
       SWAMP-in-a-Box host.

    2. On the SWAMP-in-a-Box host, for each file, run the platform install
       script, providing the path to the '.qcow2.gz' file. The script must
       be run as 'root'; the command below uses 'sudo' to ensure this.

            sudo /opt/swamp/bin/install_platform [platform-file].qcow2.gz

    3. When prompted, provide the SWAMP-in-a-Box database root password,
       which is needed to update the database entries for the platform.
